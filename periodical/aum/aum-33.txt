  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:

Light reveals and manifests life only when aspiration ceaselessly feeds our inner hunger.



* Harmony

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:398
  :END:


The divine harmony is and can be established in one's inner and outer nature only when one accepts the inner life as a source of constant inspiration to guide, mould and shape the outer life.



* Happiness

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:399
  :END:


Happiness is the invaluable treasure of the Supreme. You are bound to get this treasure the moment your heart says "What I have and what am is God's and God's alone."

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:400

There is a flower deep inside our heart and the name of that flower is Purity. Purity is man's everlasting link with God's immortal and infinite life.



* Self-realisation

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:401
  :END:


Self-realisation is man's first and foremost goal. In self-realisation man's aspiration grows eventually into the very image of God.



* Courage

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:402
  :END:


The very acceptance of the spiritual life demands enormous courage. It is only a divinely courageous soul, only a divinely inspired soul that swiftly reaches the highest Goal.



* Fulfilment

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:403
  :END:


Fulfilment lies in one's utter consecration to the life divine. The more consciously one consecrates oneself to the Supreme, the sooner is one’s total fulfilment.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:405

* Tolerance

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:406
  :END:


The Supreme is dearest to us purely because he is All-tolerance. Again when we go deep within we see it is not tolerance. It is His all-loving oneness. He expresses Himself through human imperfection, through human limitations, human failure, not on the strength of tolerance but on the strength of His spontaneous, soulful concern for His children.



* Vital

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:407

  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:408

  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:409

* Divinity

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:410
  :END:


The seeker's highest divinity lies not in the world of the past, but in the immediacy of today's deepest aspiration. The aspiration that leads the aspirant to God-realisation is the harbinger of the aspirant's inner divinity.



* Aspiration

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:411
  :END:


No aspiration, no realisation. What is aspiration? Aspiration in man's conscious cry to climb up the Highest, to run the Farthest and dive the Deepest.



* Dog

  :PROPERTIES:
  :genre: aphorism
  :keywords:
  :cite-key: AUM:412

  :genre: aphorism

Your father and mother have brought you into the world from God. Your spiritual father, your Guru, will take you back to God consciously and safely after making you the very image of God.



* The Song universal[fn:: This was a special lecture, given under the auspices of the Church Center for the United Nations, closely connected with the U. N. The function, which took place on November 26, 1968, was arranged and organised by N and S K. Sri Chinmoy offers them his deepest, grateful blessings.

The Song universal is freedom. Freedom from what? Freedom from limitations, freedom from imperfections and freedom from ignorance. Man is in stark bondage. Nevertheless, man has the power deep within him to cut asunder the teeming ties that have bound him and forced him to launch into the sea of uncertainty.

Four thousand years ago the Vedic seers voiced forth:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"Give freedom for our bodies,
Give freedom for our dwelling,
Give freedom for our life."

#+END_QUOTE

This soulful prayer of the Vedic seers of yore will echo and re-echo in humanity's aspiring heart through eternity.

Freedom does not mean to be away from home. Freedom means to accept and feel the entire world as one's real home, as one's very own. With a view to achieving and growing into this peerless freedom, man does many things. He simply throws himself into a tornado of blind activities. Man has to learn that he has only one thing to do; and that is to discover and uncover. He has to discover the Divinity within and uncover the veil of ignorance without. Likewise, he has only one thing to to be -- God. He has to be God the Infinite, God the Eternal and God the Immortal.

It is said that the quickest way to do many things is to do only one thing at a time. Let us start by thinking of, concentrating and meditating on God and end, if there is any end, with God-realisation. This is not only the quickest, but by far the best.

God is Freedom. In an unparalleled way, the Isha Upanishad speaks of God the Absolute.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"It moves. It moves not.
Far it is. And it is near.
Within all this it is.
It is without all this."

#+END_QUOTE

Man's deepest faith in God and man's boundless freedom in himself go together. Sublimely significant is the truth that is offered to us by J. M. Barrie:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"The reason why birds can fly and we can't is simply is that they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings."

#+END_QUOTE

"We walk by faith, not by sight." An aspirant, a true seeker of the Infinite Freedom has to breathe in this life-giving and life-transforming truth that the New Testament endows us with.

Man is sick. His sickness is his ignorance. He has been suffering from this unfathomable ignorance for millennia. There is considerable truth in what Bernard Shaw says: "We have not lost faith, but we have transferred it from God to the medical profession." Now I wish to say that it is high time for us to come out of ignorance-sleep. Let us not play the fool. Let us be wise once again. Let us re-transfer our faith to God who alone can and will cure our entire life, earthly existence, of ignorance-sickness which is undoubtedly the worst.

We all are assembled at the Church Center for the United Nations. The word 'United' is most hallowed. It can better be felt than described. Or should I say, it can only be felt and cannot be described at all. "United we stand, divided we fall." We are fully aware of this maxim. What we need is to live it.

Now where does this unity come from? It comes from God. It comes from the Brahman, the One without a second. Farther when we walk along the path of unity, we realise that God has not only the Consciousness of Unity but He is Consciousness-Unity Itself. When we reach the end of our journey's goal, we discover that God is both Unity and Multiplicity. In the field of Unity He is Realisation and Liberation and in the field of Multiplicity He is Manifestation and Transformation.

Our inner realisation and outer action must run abreast. Outer achievements should be the conscious and spontaneous revelation of the inner divinity.

Love, harmony, peace and oneness. These are man's divine ideals. On the strength of his inner mounting flame, aspiration, man can manifest easily, unerringly and spontaneously these ideals of his in his human life, every sphere of his life.

It is quite natural and proper that we should discover our God in and through our own religion. To be sure, there is only one religion and that religion is man's inmost cry for God-realisation. In the hoary past, Asoka, the great Emperor of India, sent missionaries to other corners of the Globe with a profound message:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"The basis of all religions is the same, wherever they are; try to help them all you can, teach them all you can, but do not try to injure them."

#+END_QUOTE

Let each religion play the role of a flower. Let us make a garland of these divine flowers and offer them at the Feet of God. God will be pleased. We shall be fulfilled.

As there is only one Religion, even so there is only one one Song. This Song is man.

#+BEGIN_VERSE

Man is Infinity's Heart.
Man is Eternity's Breath.
Man is Immortality's Life.

* Man and his goal[fn::  AUM 418. This talk was given at the State University of New York, Farmingdale, N. Y., on December 11, 1968.]

  :END:


My dear friends, you are fortunate, you are special.

A significant branch of the State University significantly helps you to specialise here in horticulture and agriculture. Soon you are going to be at home in the science of plant-life and the cultivation of the soil. In a broader and purer sense, you are making a solemn promise to the world at large that you wish to be the true children of Nature, Mother-Earth.

By the way, I am sure, you all know that it was an Indian scientist, Sir J. C. Bose, who was the discoverer of life in plants. He was born in Bengal. I am proud that I was born in the same province.

Your genuine love of Nature enables and entitles you to receive special love, concern, favour and blessings from the universe, the Universal Life and the Universal Mother.

A man said to the universe:

"Sir, I exist!"

"However," replied the universe,

"The fact has not created in me a sense of obligation."

This sound and striking pronouncement of Stephen Crane does not apply to you in the least. Nevertheless, others may rightly deserve this fatal fate. I wish to tell you that the universe, the universal Life and the universal Mother will proudly bless your devoted heads and dedicated hearts, for you love Nature, you adore Nature. What is Nature? Nature is God the Mother. In His masculine aspect, God is Transcendental. In His feminine aspect, God is Universal. Let us invoke the presence of God the Universal Mother before we enter into "Man and His Goal."

[/A three-minute meditation followed./]

Man's goal is the human love. Human love sadly fails, Man’s goal is the physical beauty. Physical beauty is but skin-deep: Man's goal is money, material wealth. "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man enter into the kingdom of Heaven."

Man's goal is Truth. Truth awakens him from his ignorance-sleep. Man's goal is Peace. Peace feeds him, his life inner and outer. Man's goal is Bliss. Bliss immortalises him, his life-breath.

Self-realisation. This is what man needs from God. Love. This is what God needs from man. Faith. This is what God always has in man. But alas, man has to develop faith in himself and faith in God.

Man unfalteringly says: "If I had time, I would love God If I had time, I would worship God. If I had time, I would even cry for God."

But poor God has time. He has time to forgive man's unending stupidity. He has time to bless man's shameless mind and grant him all his real necessities. He has time even to cry for man's yet unborn sincerity.

Man and God. Try to realise God. Both God and man will say to you: "Wonderful, go ahead." Try to explain God. Man will immediately tell you: "Stop, don't belittle God, don't torture God." God will voice forth: "Stop, for my sake at least, don't deceive men, don't deceive my children."

Let us not try to explain God. If we do that, our ignorance will be exposed. Let all of us realise God and for that what we need is meditation. Let us meditate, meditate on God.

Man has to walk far, very far. He has to reach the Shores of the Golden Beyond. Slowly, steadily and unerringly he has to walk. But he needs must walk forward and not backward. Lincoln welcomes man, his fellow traveller, to sing with him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"I am a slow walker, but I never walk backward."

#+END_QUOTE

We believe in evolution. We certainly do. Man is not going back to the animal kingdom. Man is proceeding towards the Kingdom of Heaven which perpetually breathes, grows and glows in the inmost recesses of his heart.

Friends, you are cultivating knowledge. We all do it. Each human being must own a bumper crop of knowledge.

Somebody said: "A college degree is often the receipt a young man gets for bills his father paid."

I make bold to say that I reject this eyeless idea outright. Your parents desire that you learn how to swim in the sea of knowledge. Your Professors who are the.expert swimmers in the sea of knowledge teach you successfully and gloriously how to swim, I deeply admire your zealous sincerity, your Professors' enormous capacity. But, alas, knowledge, book-knowledge, is not enough. You all know it. I have not discovered something new or fantastic, far from it. I just wanted to remind you of the soulful fact that there is another sea. This Sea is the Sea of Divine Light, Peace, Bliss and Power. This Sea gives you realisation and liberation. You will have the realisation of your conscious and indivisible oneness with God. You will have liberation from your bondage of millenia. This Sea gives you Fulfilment Infinite. Something more, this Sea makes you feel in a perfectly convincing manner that you are truly and unmistakably tomorrow's God.

Who says that man is sleeping? No, he is not. He woke up with his teeming desires and was fully ready but soon he discovered that God was not ready and will never be ready to receive him.

Man woke up with his flaming aspiration, but was unpardonably late. Yet God was eager to receive him, embrace him and finally place him on His own Transcendental Throne.

We bow to fear.
Fear fearfully
Bowed and bowed
To Eisenhower.
We think of war;
War thought of Eisenhower --
Victory too.

Two infinite extremes:
War and Peace --
War the destroyer
Of blooming world,
Peace the devourer
Of roaring War.

Eisenhower,
The Thunder
Of the Omnipotent,
Divinely arranged
For their dinner.
A dinner unprecedented,
And inimitable, too.

Both the Princes came in.
Two hearts became one
In a golden embrace.
They grew into all delight.

Dinner over,
War sat in absolute relief
At the feet of Eisenhower.
Peace commenced his dance,
A perfect stranger
To the dark hush of extinction—Night.

God smiled.
In words of dynamic Silence He spoke
"The Man of the Hour."
